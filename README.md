An exploration of the popular Kaggle House Prices dataset.

My first Kaggle notebook explores the well known house prices dataset. [This](https://www.kaggle.com/erikbruin/house-prices-lasso-xgboost-and-a-detailed-eda) kernel deserves much credit. I referenced it throughout the creation of this notebook, taking the same approach to feature engineering and missing value imputation. 

My first submission achieved results in the 22nd percentile. The Kaggle kernel can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/dtamming/house-prices).
